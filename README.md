# Learning Android Playground

This repository is intended to accompany my journey through Udacity Android Nanodegree. Here is where I practice or experiment with concepts from the Nanodegree or otherwise.

## Content Provider
Learning how to use content resolvers and content providers

### Content Resolver Example
Using contacts content provider to learn how to get data from an existing content provider. This gives an overview of *content resolver* and how to use *cursor* which is a reference to the query result

While working on this exercise, I started with attempting to get User Dictionary, but this effort was not very successful on my hardware (Samsung devices). It seems that Samsung overrides the user dictionary and provide its own implementation!. Anyways, if you follow the commit history, you will find that I have switch to Contacts at some point.
